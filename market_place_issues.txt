Based on my analysis of the Marketplace feature, I can identify several potential issues and areas that need improvement. Let me provide you with a comprehensive breakdown:

Current State:
The marketplace is currently a static frontend-only implementation with mock data. Here are the identified issues:


1. No Backend Integration
❌ No API endpoints for marketplace functionality
❌ No database tables for products, orders, or transactions
❌ No real data persistence - everything is hardcoded mock data
❌ No user authentication for marketplace actions

2. Non-Functional Features
❌ "List Item" button - No functionality implemented
❌ "Buy Now" buttons - No purchase flow
❌ "Load More" button - No pagination or data loading
❌ "More Filters" button - No additional filtering options
❌ Wishlist/Heart buttons - No functionality
❌ Product details/View buttons - No product detail pages

3. Missing Core Functionality
❌ No product management (CRUD operations)
❌ No order processing
❌ No payment integration
❌ No seller/buyer management
❌ No inventory tracking
❌ No review/rating system (only mock data)
